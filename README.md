# Ideas for startups

Here are some ideas which I would love solutions for. Primarily arising from my experience of running [SigNoz](https://twitter.com/SigNozHQ) 

Though, being an enterpreneur myself, I would really want to work on a few of these ideas. But I have my plate full currently :) 

Of course, I haven't looked at all the products in the world, so may be there is a product which already solves one of these. If you know about them, please share with me by creating and issue/ PR and I will update.

So, open sourcing it in case someone finds it useful.


(Listed in no particular order)

### 1. Mailchimp alternative which is not markety and sends email in plain text/ minimal formating

I am looking for a way to send newsletter to our community, which ideally works with .md formatting. Mailchimp is too markety

Also, should not be priced for mid market/ Enterprise. i.e. similar pricing structure as Mailchimp

I need minimal formating options. Also, should have good deliverability rate and options/best practices to improve deliverability

### 2. Bi directional sync between slack threads and Notion 

We use slack actively for team communications, and Notion for longer term docs like PRD, strategic plans, etc.

I would love to sync some of the interesting conversations in Notion for future reference. Current tools, only synce the first message in the thread. Can there be a tool which syncs the complete thread and keeps it synced as new comments/replies come.

I think slack link could work for this, but needs to click another link. Many times currently I add screenshots of conversations. I think there could be something better here

### 3. Bi directional sync between slack threads and CRM tools (Hubspot) 

Many of our user conversations happen in slack community. I would love to sync some of the interesting conversations in our CRM for future reference. Current tools, only synce the first message in the thread. Can there be a tool which syncs the complete thread and keeps it synced as new comments/replies come.

### 4. Tools to run open source GPT3 like models ( like Stable Diffusion) in our own infra

I would like to try if we can provide chat like interface as a feature for some parts of the product. Transformer models like GPT3 seem quite good at it
But using GPT3 model itself would be cost prohibitive from a business models perspective ( each search would cost dollars)

I think, if we run the models in our own infra - cost much more manageable (atleast not linearly scale with API calls)

### 5. Tools to set up data pipeline easily (Added Dec 2023)

I want to create a datastack with Segment -> DBT -> Fivetran/Airbyte -> BigQuery -> Metabase/Redash (Visualization tool) as any analytics tool gets restrictive after some time, and more feature rich analytics(like amplitide) tool cost a bomb. Any products which helps set up the data stack would be very helfpul ( though not sure how much this can be productised and if it's a services play)
